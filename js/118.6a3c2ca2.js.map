I am interested in everything \r\n              related to information technology, including programming, web development, \r\n              computer and network security. My first knowledge began in the world of \r\n              servers with Linux and Windows, there, I managed to implement solutions in \r\n              Amazon and Google Cloud. In addition, in my professional practice, \r\n              I have carried out various roles that have guided me as a Software and \r\n              Backend developer, through self-learning and the application of technologies \r\n              such as JavaScript, PHP and Python, \r\n              creating HTML layout with CSS and SASS, I have executed code tools I open \r\n              Bootstrap for site design and web development and in my projects, when \r\n              I need to speed up the development process, I apply Docker mounts with \r\n              GIT repositories. Also, thanks to my work experience I have acquired knowledge \r\n              in frameworks with Codeigniter and some Laravel, in addition, I have extensive \r\n              experience in managing Mysql, Postgres, Oracle and Mongo DB databases. I consider \r\n              myself self-taught and I am fascinated by research, through it, I am able to \r\n              complement the knowledge of my profession, because I consider it a personal challenge \r\n              to be able to develop projects that allow my continuous learning and that facilitate \r\n              the performance of the proposed tasks, the acquisition of strengths and skills that \r\n              guarantee my excellent professional performance, managing to be proactive within the \r\n              company to which I belong, Likewise, I have strengths such as punctuality, assertive \r\n              communication, responsibility, commitment and organization, I firmly believe that \r\n              teamwork , the adequate planning of the activities and the execution of the schedules \r\n              in the stipulated times guarantee the fulfillment in the development of the projects \r\n              and therefore the satisfaction of the client and strengthening of the company to \r\n              which it is linked.</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-2\">\r\n            <h6>Quick Links</h6>\r\n            <ul class=\"footer-links\">\r\n              <li><a href='https://cyberscuba.github.io/'>About</a></li>\r\n              <li><a href='mailto:charlysumo@gmail.com'>Contact me</a></li>\r\n              <li><a href='tel:+0573108030240'>+57308030240</a></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <hr>\r\n          <div class=\"col-xs-12 col-md-12\">\r\n            <p class=\"copyright-text\">Copyright &copy; 2022\r\n              <a href=\"#\">Carlos A Martínez</a>.\r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n</footer>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'CommicFooter',\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n<style>\r\n\r\n</style>\r\n","import { render } from \"./CommicFooter.vue?vue&type=template&id=4742c1f8\"\nimport script from \"./CommicFooter.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./CommicFooter.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\Carlos A Martínez\\\\Documents\\\\MyStuffs\\\\TechnicalTests\\\\massiviancommics\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_hoisted_2","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_3","name","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
